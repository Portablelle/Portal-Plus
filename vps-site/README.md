# Portal+ PS5 launch portal

Release 1.5.2 improves game cover matching through the companion artwork service.
Deploy `botty-artwork-1.5.2.tar.gz` separately on the artwork host and merge its
verified aliases and product mappings into the existing configuration.

Service 1.5.1 fixes the native app's Offline regression introduced in 1.5.0 by
restoring the flat `/health` API contract. Rest-mode maintenance is retained.

This directory is the standalone static Relapse portal. Press **LAUNCH** once on
a supported PS5 browser and keep the page open. Launch options select Botty+,
FTP (2121), standalone rTorrent and CheatRunner; these default to enabled and
choices are saved in this browser. Botty+ selection installs/updates its native
app before ShadowMountPlus scans homebrew and starts its manager, compression
worker and rTorrent dependency. Disabling Botty+ skips all its installation and
startup work. Other selected apps continue to work independently. Disabling an
option leaves existing files and running services untouched.
After setup, read the session-result panel and status. The button returns to
**LAUNCH** when setup finishes without a blocking failure, or shows **STOPPED**
when setup stops. Each component has an explicit label: **Ready**, **Not
requested**, **Failed**, **Deferred**, **Update on next startup** or **Sent —
startup unconfirmed**. Optional failures do not hide confirmed services, and
an interrupted setup retains its earlier results. Successfully delivered Kstuff
and ShadowMountPlus payloads show **Sent — startup unconfirmed** because delivery
is not a startup check. A failed send shows **Failed**; a payload not reached
before setup stops remains **Deferred** with **Not executed yet**.
App preparation or registration does not confirm home-screen visibility. Once
you have checked the relevant console notifications and component results, press
PS and open an available installed app. On a blocking setup failure, restart the
PS5 before trying again.

The VPS follows the latest verified Botty+ packages committed to its separate
`main` branch. Maintained app/service source lives in
[Botty+](https://github.com/Portablelle/Botty-Plus); Portal+ owns its installers.

The optional **A53 PPR patch** is unchecked by default and available only on firmware
up to 11.40. Its choice is saved in this browser. Close games and let mounts and
unmounts finish before using it. The standard `a53_ppr_install.elf` runs after
Kstuff and before ShadowMountPlus. Wait for its successful notification, then
select **CONTINUE**; on failure, restart the console. Delivery alone does not
confirm installation. See its [notice](payloads/ppr-patch-NOTICE.md),
[license](payloads/ppr-patch-LICENSE.txt) and
[source](payloads/ppr-patch-source.tar.gz).

**Codex PS5 (prototype)** is an opt-in launch option. When selected, LAUNCH checks
its pinned release manifest and installs or updates the native title, multilingual
Whisper base model and assistant engine before starting it. Downloads use verified
1 MiB blocks and reuse unchanged local blocks. Old installations are backed up,
with a journal to finish interrupted publication on the next launch. After successful verification, a release-bound receipt caches each file's size,
inode, modification/change timestamps and other stable stat metadata. Unchanged
files skip content hashing on later launches; changed or unknown metadata and a
missing/invalid receipt trigger full verification. The first launch after upgrading
from portal 1.5.3 creates this receipt once. The engine is always verified block by
block during its single transfer to the loader; cold boots still require that
transfer. Codex reads/writes use bounded 1 MiB buffers to reduce ROP calls. ChatGPT
credentials and the workspace are preserved. Updates wait while Botty is busy or
native apps are open. Close native apps before LAUNCH; a legacy engine without the
new control endpoint needs one full PS5 restart after its files are updated.
Subsequent idle engines can stop cleanly and restart with the new release.
Open Codex PS5 in the game library: L1 signs in to ChatGPT; Triangle records local
voice dictation; Options sends the prompt. The model is GPT 6.1 SOL with low
reasoning effort. Native dictation and administration tools were tested on the
console; this automatic update flow still needs acceptance through PS5 LAUNCH.

Home-screen registration is asynchronous. Restart after a failed session.

Portal release 1.5.4 includes service 1.5.1: missing or invalid Prowlarr configuration
shows an inline Search/Explore message and leaves other tabs available. Search
recovers after configuration is corrected without restarting the service.
The web interface also accepts `.torrent` uploads, with destination selection when
an external disk is connected and normal download tracking in Botty+.
Service 1.5.1 renews the system's rest-mode keep-main request every ten seconds
for its whole lifetime on firmware 7.00–13.60. Its web footer and API expose the
current acceptance/expiry/failure status. There is no ten-minute limit. Missing
API support or a rejected request disables maintenance while keeping Botty usable.
Closing Botty+ leaves the service and maintenance running. This holds the main
processor in standby and may use more power than deep rest.
FTP and a generated 8 MiB torrent download passed rest-mode trials on 13.00;
upload, extraction, compression and other firmwares remain unvalidated on hardware.
If an older service is running, LAUNCH stages 1.5.1 without stopping its work;
start a fresh console session and LAUNCH to activate it.

Native 01.004.000 and rTorrent 0.16.24-botty4 retain their existing versions. ShadowMountPlus is now 1.7beta5-fix1-botty.1. Existing Transmission installations need an
explicit migration before rTorrent can start; keep original metadata and downloads.
The separate artwork service must also be updated to obtain the blank-cover fix.

The bundled offset files cover 7.00–13.60. This does not establish full-stack
compatibility across that range. Hardware observations are limited to 13.00.

The full repository includes `README.md`, `deployment/README.md` and
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` with hosting, console setup, updates and build instructions:

Host the complete verified export at the root of a trusted HTTPS origin. Package
verification requires Web Crypto. The browser fetches payloads and applications
from relative paths; there is no maintainer-hosted domain dependency. Do not
rewrite package contents, cache incompatible releases together or serve local
backup directories. `manifest.json` inventories the exported files.

The installer preserves existing matching files and running services. A recognized older native title is updated with the app closed after staging and
verification, with its previous directory retained in private storage. Foreign
titles and downgrades are refused. Interrupted swaps recover through a journal.
A newer service is staged while an old daemon continues its active work; it starts
on the next console restart. FTP is loaded again after reboot;
successful payload delivery is not proof that a payload initialized correctly.

## Upstream credits

The browser stage uses JavaScriptCore information leaks and a structured-clone
object pool mismatch. The kernel stage combines an address leak with an
`aio_multi_wait` use-after-free race.

- Sonic_Iso: kernel exploit.
- Jordy: WebKit exploit and kernel bug.
- ntfargo and ufm42: exploit development.
- Dr. Yenyen: testing.
- Additional contributors: TheFlow, SlidyBat, Flatz, cow, nhk, bollarz,
  Sleirsgoevy, EchoStretch and EarthOnion.

Upstream revision is recorded in `manifest.json` and in the repository's
`Relapse-Exploit` submodule. Preserve the upstream `LICENSE` and attribution.

The bundled ShadowMountPlus `1.7beta5-fix1-botty.1` includes Botty's guarded TitleDir
recovery, pinned ShellCore hooks and guarded background storage operations while Botty+ is active, alongside upstream beta5-fix1 hook recovery, fakelib modes and external-storage fixes. This version still needs console acceptance with the bundled Kstuff Lite. Its [notice](payloads/shadowmountplus-NOTICE.md),
[GPL license](payloads/shadowmountplus-LICENSE.txt) and
[complete corresponding source](payloads/shadowmountplus-source.tar.gz)
are included in this portal.

Library compression retains the original until the user explicitly requests its
deletion. Full content verification is optional; skipped checks remain marked
Not verified. Close Botty+ when prompted to complete compressed-copy activation. When Botty+ is selected, the portal also installs and starts the loopback compression
worker. Existing running services are left alone; staged updates start next session.

Release 1.2.2 authorizes the worker's loopback port 5910 during launch. Retrying
failed or cancelled compression through **Compress game** removes only the
tracked unfinished image and hash sidecar before checking free space and
restarting from zero. The original is kept. Completed images and uncertain
activation/deletion operations remain protected; checkpoint resume is unsupported.

## CheatRunner

When CheatRunner is selected, LAUNCH prepares the pinned CheatRunner 0.17.2-botty.1 service on port 9999, with its
original home-screen tile under **Media / Media Players** (CHTR09999). After a
reboot, run LAUNCH before opening the tile. The Portal also exposes **Open
CheatRunner** when the HTTP service is ready. No page is added to Botty+.

Existing running instances and all cheat/patch/profile files are preserved. The
ShellUI hotkey is disabled before a fresh payload start. Startup is deferred while
Botty is extracting, transferring or compressing; a CheatRunner error leaves the
Botty session usable and is displayed in the session log. Tile registration and
HTTP health do not certify launch or cheat compatibility on 13.00/Relapse.

[Upstream provenance and integration notes](apps/cheatrunner/NOTICE.md),
[GPL-3.0 license](apps/cheatrunner/LICENSE),
[published upstream source snapshot](apps/cheatrunner/cheatrunner-source.tar.gz).
The snapshot does not include the upstream embedded tile's missing build recipe.

## Content verification policy

Extra completion rehash, cross-disk full comparison and automatic post-compression
comparison are disabled. Piece validation, RAR CRC, completed writes/fsync, file
sizes and mount checks remain. Compressed copies are ready but **Not verified**;
the original is retained. The service web UI offers an explicit full comparison
and a cooperative skip. A copied compressed image loses any prior verified flag.

## Background storage in 1.4.0

Supported Library moves and deletions continue while Botty+ stays open, with
live progress and retained failure details in Processing and the web interface.
The bundled ShadowMount checks the active title and mounts before allowing
these operations. New-title registration, compressed-copy activation/restoration
and unsupported operations still retain their session requirements. Host
regressions and PS5 cross-builds passed; console acceptance of these new
background operations remains pending.
